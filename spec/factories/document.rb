EUROPEAN CHARTER FOR REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES



APPLICATION OF THE CHARTER IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
monitoring cycle

A. Report of the Committee of Experts on the Charter

B. Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers of the
Council of Europe on the application of the Charter by the
United Kingdom






The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages provides for a control mechanism to evaluate how
the Charter is applied in a State Party with a view to, where necessary, making recommendations for
improving its language legislation, policy and practices. The central element of this procedure is the
Committee of Experts, set up under Article 17 of the Charter. Its principal purpose is to report to the
Committee of Ministers on its evaluation of compliance by a Party with its undertakings, to examine the real
situation of regional or minority languages in the State and, where appropriate, to encourage the Party to
gradually reach a higher level of commitment.

To facilitate this task, the Committee of Ministers adopted, in accordance with Article 15, paragraph1, an
outline for periodical reports that a Party is required to submit to the Secretary General. The report should be
made public by the State. This outline requires the State to give an account of the concrete application of the
Charter, the general policy for the languages protected under Part Il and, in more precise terms, all
measures that have been taken in application of the provisions chosen for each language protected under
Part Ill of the Charter. The Committee of Experts  first task is therefore to examine the information contained
in the periodical report for all the relevant regional or minority languages on the territory of the State
concerned.

The Committee of Experts  role is to evaluate the existing legal acts, regulations and real practice applied in
each State for its regional or minority languages. It has established its working methods accordingly. The
Committee of Experts gathers information from the respective authorities and from independent sources
within the State, so as to attempt to obtain a fair and just overview of the real language situation. After a
preliminary examination of an initial periodical report, the Committee of Experts submits, if necessary, a
number of questions to each Party to obtain supplementary information from the authorities on matters it
considers insufficiently developed in the report itself. This written procedure is usually followed up by an on-
the-spot visit by a delegation of the Committee of Experts to the State in question. During this visit the
delegation meets bodies and associations whose work is closely related to the use of the relevant
languages, and consults the authorities on matters that have been brought to its attention. This information-
gathering process is designed to enable the Committee of Experts to evaluate more effectively the
application of the Charter in the State concerned.

Having concluded this process, the Committee of Experts adopts its own report. This report is submitted to
the Committee of Ministers, together with suggestions for recommendations that the latter may decide to
address to the State Party.

A. Report of the Committee of Experts on the application of the Charter in the
United Kingdom

adopted by the Committee of Experts on 21 June 2013
and presented to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe
in accordance with Article 16 of the Charter

Chapter 1 Background information

1.1. Ratification of the Charter by the United Kingdom

1. The United Kingdom signed the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (hereafter
referred to as  the Charter ) on 2 March 2000, and ratified it on 27 March 2001. It entered into force on
1 July 2001. The instrument of ratification and subsequent declarations are set out in Appendix of this
report.

2. The authorities of the United Kingdom presented their fourth periodical report to the Secretary
General of the Council of Europe on 11 March 2013, 10 months after it was due. This is the second time that
the UK authorities submitted the periodical report after a substantial delay. In addition the report is
incomplete, lacking information about the situation in Northern Ireland. The delay has hampered the process
of timely and effective application of charter provisions throughout the UK.

3. This fourth evaluation report is based on the information obtained by the Committee of Experts from
the fourth periodical report of the UK as well as through meetings held with representatives of speakers of
regional or minority languages in the UK and the UK authorities during the on-the-spot visit, which took place
from 29 April to 2 May 2013. The Committee of Experts also received an extensive number of comments
from bodies and associations legally established in the UK, submitted pursuant to Article 16 paragraph 2 of
the Charter. This information was very helpful in the course of evaluating the application of the Charter and
the Committee of Experts would like to express its appreciation to these organisations for their valuable
contribution and participation in the monitoring process.

4. The present report contains detailed observations which the UK authorities are encouraged to take
into account when developing their policy on regional or minority languages. On the basis of these detailed
observations, the Committee of Experts has also established a list of general proposals for the preparation of
a fourth set of recommendations to be addressed to the UK by the Committee of Ministers, as provided in
Article 16, paragraph 4 of the Charter.

5. This present fourth report was adopted by the Committee of Experts on 21 June 2013.
1.2. Presentation of the regional or minority language situation in the United Kingdom: update

6. The Committee of Experts refers to the relevant paragraphs of the first, second and third evaluation
reports  for basic information on the situation of regional or minority languages in the UK. The regional or
minority languages covered under the Charter in the UK are Welsh, Scottish Gaelic, Irish, Scots, Ulster Scots
and Cornish. Manx Gaelic in the Isle of Man is also covered under the Charter. Welsh, Scottish Gaelic and
Irish have been granted protection under Part Ill of the Charter, as stated in the instrument of ratification.

7. New developments will be dealt with under Part II and Part Ill, wnere appropriate. The results of the
2011 census concerning the number of speakers of regional or minority languages in the UK are partly
known. There is information on the census results in Wales, but not for the other languages included in the
census.  In the 2011 census, 19% (562,000) of Welsh residents aged three and over reported being able to
speak Welsh, while in the 2001 Census 20.8% of the population (582,000) had reported being able to speak
Welsh. Although the overall decline is not great, there have been worrying falls in numbers of speakers in the



First evaluation report of the Committee of Experts on the application of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in
the United Kingdom, ECRML (2004) 1 Second evaluation report on the application of the European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages in the United Kingdom, ECRML (2007) 2. Third evaluation report on the application of the European Charter for Regional or
Minority Languages in the United Kingdom, ECRML (2010) 4.





4
traditionally strong areas of North and West Wales, with two counties (Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire)
becoming less than 50% Welsh-speaking for the first time in history.

Cornish

8. At the time of the last report, the Cornish Language Partnership (CLP) had commissioned a survey
of speakers which gave a figure of 699 speakers at three levels of competency. The survey did not claim to
capture all speakers but to provide a baseline. The CLP survey is not due to be updated until 2013, but the
Partnership continues to monitor numbers in classes and the number taking and passing examinations in the
language. These statistics show a steady but modest increase.

Scots

9. In its second evaluation report, the Committee of Experts noted that there was only an estimate of
the number of speakers of Scots and stressed the need for an assessment of the number of speakers as an
essential basis for developing a comprehensive language policy. In the fourth periodical report the United
Kingdom authorities stated that detailed information based on the 2011 census is not yet available.

1.3. Particular issues arising in the evaluation of the application of the Charter in the United
Kingdom

10. As mentioned in the first evaluation report, the responsibility for the practical implementation of the
Charter lies within the devolved administrations, with the exception of the Cornish language and those
undertakings that lie directly within the competence of the central authorities. The UK Government
nevertheless has the final responsibility under international law for the implementation of the Charter. During
the on-the-spot visit the Cornish Language Partnership drew the attention of the Committee of Experts to the
lack of engagement of the UK Government concerning the development of the Cornish language. The UK
Government does not introduce measures to promote the Cornish language nor remove barriers to progress.

11. Apart from Northern Ireland (see paragraph 12), the Committee of Experts notes that the fourth
periodical report is more coherent and informative and deals with most of the relevant issues that had been
raised in the previous monitoring round. The fourth periodical report provides more targeted information
related to questions raised by the Committee of Experts in the framework of the third evaluation report.

12. Information about Irish and Ulster Scots in the fourth periodical report is still confined to those areas
which remain the sole competence of the UK Government in London. Areas which have been devolved to
Northern Ireland are not included. It was explained to the Committee of Experts that the responsibility for
preparing these relevant parts of the report was that of the Northern Ireland power-sharing Executive.
According to the authorities it was again not possible to agree within the Executive on the relevant text to be
included in the report. The Committee of Experts regrets that the periodical report does not include important
information relating to one Part Ill and one Part II language. It reminds the UK Government that it is its duty
under the Charter to submit a complete report on time and expects that the forthcoming report will comply in
full with Article 15 of the Charter.





The Committee of Experts strongly urges the UK authorities to comply with their obligation to report
on the application of the Charter in accordance with Article 15 of the Charter.



13. The devolution settlement in Northern Ireland presents obstacles to the promotion and the protection
of regional or minority languages to the extent that there is no political consensus on the contribution to be
made by the Northern Ireland Government. The responsibility of competence with regard to regional or
minority languages was devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly. Nevertheless, no legislation promoting
the Irish language has been adopted. The Committee of Experts was informed that this is because of the
need to obtain consensus within the power sharing administration.

14. The Committee of Experts is of the opinion that legislation is needed for the protection of the Irish
language.





The Committee of Experts strongly urges the authorities to provide an appropriate legislative base
for the protection and promotion of Irish in Northern Ireland.



15. During the on-the-spot visit the Committee of Experts observed that amongst speakers there was a
spirit of mutual understanding between those wishing to promote the Irish language and the promotion of
Ulster Scots. There was a realisation that the situation and needs of the two languages were different. The




Committee of Experts was particularly encouraged by initiatives taken by the Minister for the Department of
Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) to bring the two language communities together. This spirit of mutual
tolerance and understanding appears to the Committee of Experts to be a valuable platform on which to
build a political consensus.
Chapter 2 Conclusions of the Committee of Experts on how the State authorities
have reacted to the recommendations of the Committee of Ministers
(RecChL(2010)4)

Recommendation No.1:

 continue to take resolute action for the protection and promotion of Scottish Gaelic in all areas, and in
particular strengthen Scottish Gaelic education, especially through the training of teachers and the
production of teaching and learning materials;

16. Efforts to promote the Scottish Gaelic language continue, with considerable support and goodwill
from the Scottish Executive. The development of the television channel BBC Alba has, in particular, been a
success. Nevertheless, in the field of education considerable practical difficulties remain. There have been
initiatives in relation to teacher training and teaching materials, but there is still a serious shortage of
teachers, and there is a need for further resolute action in this area.

Recommendation No.2:

 adopt and implement a comprehensive Irish language policy, preferably through the adoption of legislation .
17. No steps have been taken to implement this recommendation. Promotion of the Irish language
remains, regrettably, a highly contentious issue in Northern Ireland.

Recommendation No.3:

 ensure that health and social care facilities offer services in Welsh .

18. Following consultations with interested parties during 2010 the Welsh Government decided to
develop a strategic framework to strengthen Welsh language provision within health and social services. The
framework was published in November 2012 and it confirmed the Government's commitment to strengthen
Welsh language services to service users and their families with the focus of the work being on developing
front line services. Notwithstanding these positive developments, there remains considerable concern about
the situation on the ground, and the Welsh Language Commissioner has launched a statutory investigation
into the whole question on the use of Welsh in health and social services.

Recommendation No.4:

 adopt a strategy to enhance and develop Ulster Scots, in co-operation with the speakers .

19. The position of Ulster Scots has improved since the previous monitoring round, thanks largely to the

work of Tha Boord Ulst r-Scotch (Ulster-Scots Agency), which has had a proactive role in developing a
strategy for Ulster Scots, based on firm language planning grounds.
Chapter 3 The Committee of Experts  evaluation in respect of Parts Il and Ill of the
Charter

3.1. Evaluation in respect of Part Il of the Charter

20. The Committee of Experts will not comment on those provisions of Part II for which no major issues
were raised in the third evaluation report and for which the Committee of Experts has not received any new
significant information. Under Part Il, this concerns Article 7, paragraph 5. The Committee of Experts
reserves, however, the right to evaluate the implementation of this provision again at a later stage.

Article 7 - Objectives and principles

Paragraph 1

In respect of regional or minority languages, within the territories in which such languages are used and according to the
situation of each language, the Parties shall base their policies, legislation and practice on the following objectives and
principles:

a. the recognition of the regional or minority languages as an expression of cultural wealth;

Cornish

21. According to the fourth periodical report, the Cornwall County Council has a policy in place which
recognises the distinctiveness of Cornwall and the place of the language in contemporary culture and
heritage and undertakes to provide information on the language and supports development initiatives. Work
undertaken by the Cornish Language Partnership in schools aims to place the language in a cultural and
historical context, and resources produced draw on historic and contemporary culture for their frame of
reference.

Manx Gaelic

22. According to the fourth periodical report, in 2012 the Manx Heritage Foundation s Manx Language
Development Officer produced an updated review for the language. It is hoped that key partners will meet on
a regular basis to implement a long-term strategy for Manx Gaelic.

Scots

23. In the course of the third monitoring round, the Committee of Experts had noted a stronger
recognition of the Scots language. Since then, further positive developments can be noted. In the fourth
periodical report, the authorities mention the first Government-funded research into public attitudes to the
Scots language which can be seen as being recognition of the language's importance to contemporary
Scotland. The digitalisation and cataloguing of recordings from all over Scotland were also mentioned.

Scottish Gaelic

24. According to the fourth periodical report, 46 public bodies have been given notification from Bord na
Gaidhlig to prepare a Gaelic Language Plan. The Bord s Gaelic Usage Committee will take the lead in
creating strong links between the National Plan and each authority s Gaelic Language Plan. In the last state
report, the authorities mention the realisation of a study called  Public Attitude towards the Gaelic Language
which can be interpreted as recognition of the language's importance to contemporary Scotland. They also
mention the digitalisation and cataloguing of recordings from all over Scotland.

Irish

25. During the on-the-spot visit, the Committee of Experts was informed by the DCAL, that it supports an
Irish Language Act and that there are proposals for an Irish Language Bill. However, these proposals have
not led to any concrete results as yet.

b. the respect of the geographical area of each regional or minority language in order to ensure that existing or
new administrative divisions do not constitute an obstacle to the promotion of the regional or minority
language in question;

Cornish

26. According to the fourth periodical report, following the establishment of the unitary authority, Cornwall
Council accepted the role of a lead partner and accountable body and provided representation from each of
the political groupings on the council. The administrative borders of Cornwall remain the same as those for
the previous County Council.
27. During the on-the-spot visit, the Committee of Experts met with the Cornish Language Partnership
which generally viewed the structural change positively, since it strengthens the position of Cornish.
However, the Partnership deplored the limited financial support provided by UK authorities which is
inadequate to effectively reverse the language shift in respect of a critically endangered language such as
Cornish.

Irish

28. During the previous monitoring cycles, the Committee of Experts was informed of a plan to reduce
the number of 26 district councils in Northern Ireland. Some councils with a favourable Irish language policy
were concerned that merging into a larger council may diminish the favourable promotion of Irish. The fourth
periodical report does not make any mention of this issue.

29. During the on-the-spot visit, the Committee of Experts was informed that on 22 April 2013 the
transfer of powers to local councils was agreed. This will enable the transfer of a package of functions to the
11 new councils from central government departments in April 2015. The package, which will also give the
new councils more wide-ranging powers and responsibilities, has now been agreed by the Executive.
Powers will transfer in planning, road, urban regeneration, community development, housing, local economic
development and local tourism.

30. NGOs expressed their concerns to the Committee of Experts that the changing of local council areas
and amalgamating of some councils with others is likely to impact on Irish language provisions and policies,
including in the existing council areas where Irish Language Officers are currently employed.

31. The Committee of Experts therefore reiterates its concern and urges the authorities to ensure that
the new administrative divisions will not be less favourable to the existing minority language protection.

Welsh

32. Representatives of Welsh speakers explained that new legislation (The Local Government (Wales)
Measure 2011) gave the Welsh government the power to enforce the amalgamation of councils. They
expressed concern that changes could jeopardise the use of Welsh.

(o7 the need for resolute action to promote regional or minority languages in order to safeguard them;

Cornish

33. According to the fourth periodical report, action has been guided by the Cornish Language
Development Strategy, adopted in 2005, which was endorsed by the UK Government as providing the
framework for implementing Part Il of the Charter. In 2008, the government renewed and increased its
financial support and Cornwall Council renewed support, with additional in-kind support through the hosting
of the Partnership office and staff. In 2011 government funding was renewed on a tapering basis of annual
payments of  140,000,  120,000 and  100,000 with the proviso that central funding may cease after that
date. This decision was taken in light of the need to find savings in public expenditure to address the deficit.

34. The Committee of Experts is concerned that the abolishment of the central government s funding
might severely hamper the protection and promotion of Cornish. It encourages the UK authorities to engage
in a constructive dialogue with the Cornish Language Partnership in order to review the financial
contributions provided in light of the needs presented by the representatives of the Cornish language
community.

Irish

35. During the on-the-spot visit, the Committee of Experts was informed by the Minister of the DCAL,
that, under the current monitoring round, draft proposals for a strategy for the Irish language and a separate
strategy for Ulster Scots were put out for public consultation. The strategy will require cross-party support
from the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly before it can be adopted.

Scots

36. In the fourth periodical report, the authorities mention that the Scots Language Working Group was
set up to advise Ministers on the profile and needs of the Scots language. The Group published its report
and recommendations, setting out proposals to enhance the status of Scots and promote the use of all its
dialects. The work of the Group focused on sectors that have the potential to increase the use and status of
Scots, including education, broadcasting, publishing, literature and the arts.
37. During the on-the-spot visit, the Committee of Experts was informed that mainstreaming the Scots
language in literature classes has been promoted successfully.

Scottish Gaelic

38. During the on-the-spot visit, the Committee of Experts was informed of increased interaction at local
level to provide for improved exchange of information and pooling of existing resources between local
authorities in connection with the promotion of Gaelic.

Ulster Scots

39. As well as the strategy mentioned at paragraph 35 above, there have been positive developments for
Ulster Scots. During the on-the-spot visit, the Committee of Experts was impressed by the work done by Tha
Boord Ulster-Scotch (Ulster-Scots Agency) to broaden the acceptance and the use of Ulster-Scots in
everyday life. The NGO representatives flagged the need for qualified teachers in order to be able to
revitalise Ulster-Scots within mainstream society in Northern Ireland.

Welsh

40. In December 2010, the National Assembly of Wales approved the Welsh Government-proposed
Welsh Language (Wales) Measure, which became law in February 2011. A new Welsh Language Strategy
as well as a new Welsh-medium Education Strategy were published in the course of the fourth monitoring
round. The Measure provided official status for Welsh in Wales and created an entirely new regime for the
use of Welsh by public authorities and others responsible for delivering services to the public. The Welsh
Language Board was abolished, and in its place the office of the Welsh Language Commissioner
Gymraeg) was established. Under the Measure, an elaborate process has been created,
under which the Welsh Ministers can create Welsh Language Standards, which the Commissioner is then
able to impose on public authorities and others. Standards can cover not only the use of Welsh in the
delivery of services, but also in the development of policy. For the Welsh Government and Local Authorities,
standards can include obligations about promoting the Welsh language. The Commissioner has powers to
investigate any breach of standards and to impose sanctions for breach. There is currently an impasse,
since the Welsh Ministers have rejected draft standards proposed by the Commissioner, but the Welsh
Government anticipates that the standards will be in force by November 2014.

41. In the meantime, the statutory language schemes previously monitored by the Welsh Language
Board remain in force, and are monitored by the Commissioner. As bodies which now have such schemes
become subject to binding standards, their schemes fall away. The Measure also gives the Commissioner
various powers relating to the Welsh language which are similar to the promotion and advisory powers of the
Welsh Language Board, and additional powers to conduct inquiries and investigations, including a specific
power to investigate restrictions on the freedom to use Welsh. Most of the Board s previous functions in
respect of promoting the Welsh language through funding) are however now being exercised by the
Welsh Government directly.

d. the facilitation and/or encouragement of the use of regional or minority languages, in speech and writing, in
public and private life;

42. The Committee of Experts will deal with the situation of Welsh, Scottish Gaelic and Irish under the
relevant undertakings of Part below.

Cornish
43. The fourth periodical report lists a range of ways in which the use of the Cornish language has been
encouraged and facilitated in public life.

44. The CLP makes intensive use of social media, including both Facebook and Twitter, to disseminate
information and engender interest. Moreover, a number of projects have been organised which highlight
Cornish and place it in a cultural context.

45. New learning resources have been produced by the Partnership including a follow-up publication to
the Key Stage One resources identified in the last report. Activity packs for schools have been produced,
based around Christmas, St Piran s Day and Cornish Drama, while the language organisations continue to
produce a range of publications for all levels of ability.

46. As for the media, the BBC continues to provide a 5-minute news bulletin in Cornish. A series for

learners consisting of twelve 5-minute programmes has been produced by the CLP in association with My
Cornwall TV and released as a DVD. A second series has been prepared and is currently being broadcast.

10
Radio an Gernewegva, a web-based provider dependent on voluntary effort, produces half an hour of
reporting and music in Cornish each week. Discussions with community radio stations are under way with
the aim of producing some content in the near future.

Manx Gaelic

47. According to the fourth periodical report, Manx Radio, partly funded by the government, provides two
weekly programmes in Manx Gaelic and three other weekly programmes that are partly in Manx Gaelic and
partly in English. In addition, selected Manx Radio news items are translated into Manx once a week and are
made available as text and as sound files on the Manx Radio website.

48. The authorities also mentioned in their report that the Members of the Isle of Man s parliament,
Tynwald, are permitted to use relevant customary words and phrases in Manx Gaelic, provided that the
meaning of those words or phrases is either well understood or the Member provides a translation into
English if requested to so do by the presiding officer. A significant number of the Members of Tynwald do
now use such words and phrases in Manx Gaelic during parliamentary proceedings.

49. The Manx Heritage Foundation continues to support the use of the Manx language. It has an
integrated social me"

content2 = "dia presence (website, YouTube channel, twitter feed) and, in November 2012, it
launched a Manx Gaelic application for smartphones and tablets. It continues to produce material in Manx
for both adult and young readers and, in conjunction with yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh, runs a Manx Language
week in the autumn which includes lectures and social events in the language. It also has a programme of
digitalisation of archives, records and other resources. And the Coonceil ny Gaelgey, which operates as a
sub-committee of the Manx Heritage Foundation, continues to provide authoritative Manx versions of the
titles of Government Departments, street names etc. and the creation of new words and phrases in Manx
Gaelic. These terms are available at: This website has been upgraded in recent years
so that it now provides a comprehensive resource for users of the language.

Scots

50. In the third evaluation report, the Committee of Experts considered that efforts were needed to
encourage and sustain Scots as a community language and to support and create conditions for Scots-
speakers to value and use their language, and especially strengthen the position of Scots within existing
language communities.

51. In the fourth periodical report, the authorities reported on various steps taken in the course of the
reporting period, such as:

an Audit on the Scots language which provided baseline data for further research, discussions or
policy;

research on public attitudes to Scots;

the establishment of a Scots Language Working Group, which consists of representatives from the
Scots language community and who already published a report and recommendations;

the realisation of a Scots language conference;

the inclusion of a question on the Scots language in the Census of 2011 of which the results will be
available in June 2013. In order to make the census more successful a campaign to raise awareness
on the Scots language question took place and a website was developed;

the opening of a museum (Robert Burns Museum) and a project featuring more than
5,000 artefacts, including original manuscripts;

the organisation of the General Teaching Council for Scotland Awards to formally recognise the work
of a group of teachers on Scots.

Ulster Scots
52. In the fourth periodical report, the authorities referred to a new Ulster-Scots Broadcasting Fund that
was established in 2010.

e. the maintenance and development of links, in the fields covered by this Charter, between groups using a
regional or minority language and other groups in the State employing a language used in identical or similar
form, as well as the establishment of cultural relations with other groups in the State using different language;

53. There continues to be good collaboration between the agencies and bodies established to promote

regional or minority languages in the UK and there are various initiatives to promote contact between the
speakers.

11
54. The fourth periodical report states that the Cornish Language Partnership maintains links with
different language organisations and has taken part in various seminars and conferences. The Welsh
Language Board provided financial support to the London Welsh School during the 2011/2012 financial year
and hosted the secretariat for the Network to Promote Linguistic Diversity with the aim of debating issues of
common interest to regional or minority languages across Europe.

f. the provision of appropriate forms and means for the teaching and study of regional or minority languages at
all appropriate stages;

55. The teaching and study of Part languages will be examined in detail in the next section.
Cornish
56. According to the information provided by the authorities in the fourth periodical report, a Saturday

pre-school in the Camborne Redruth area teaches children and parents concurrently and will be able to
extend provision to children who may attend without their parents. Moreover, the Education Officers
have also established contact with the Cornwall Pre-School Learning Alliance and preschools are now
showing an intention to incorporate Cornish into their activities. According to the authorities, resources
established for Key Stage One have in fact proved effective with pre-school classes. During the on-the-spot-
visit, the Committee of Experts was made aware that pre-school education will be maintained despite cuts in
funding, but any additional costs will have to be borne by the parents.

57. The authorities stated in the fourth periodical report that there is a continuing and growing demand
for the use of Cornish in primary education, which is met by the use of community educators and a resource
pack that enables teachers to organise a basic programme for themselves. In-service training to teachers
and support staff in a number of primary schools has allowed the regular teaching of short programmes in
 Preparation, Planning and Assessment  time. Collaboration with partners has allowed the embedding of
Cornish into a variety of school-based projects and allowed the provision of in-house training to a number of
non-school based educators. Further resource materials have been published for this sector.

58. In their fourth periodical report, the authorities reported that Cornish is used in secondary education
only as a part of a wider languages day or initiative addressing equality, diversity and inclusion issues. Only
one or two schools offer it in a limited way and support is needed to encourage schools to make time in the
curriculum for Cornish. During the on-the-spot-visit, the Committee of Experts was made aware that funding
is decreasing while the demands expressed by parents are increasing; under these circumstances it will be
exceedingly difficult to provide for adequate teaching facilities at secondary level.

59. From a general point of view, it is stated in the fourth periodical report that a mentoring scheme is in
place for volunteers who wish to improve their teaching skills and become  community educators .
Furthermore, a partnership has been formed with a local further education college to produce a public
access virtual learning environment for students and teachers which is now well under way.

Manx Gaelic

60. According to the information provided by the authorities in the fourth periodical report, Mooinjer
Veggey operates two Manx Gaelic playgroups and four  part Manx Gaelic' nurseries. It also runs the
Bunscoill Ghaelgagh and employs an Education Officer, a Pre-School Support Officer and a Writer/Resource
Officer. Mooinjer Veggey is partly government funded and partly funded from fees and charitable donations.

61. According to the fourth periodical report, in 2011/12 there were 78 children attending the Bunscoill
Ghaelgagh or Manx-medium school where they receive their education entirely through Manx. On leaving
the Bunscoill, children have the opportunity to learn three subjects through Manx at the secondary school
within whose catchment area the Bunscoill lies. At two of the five secondary schools, Manx is an optional
timetabled subject for children in the 11-14 year old age group. Examination assessed courses, at general
and advanced level (GCSE and A-level) in the language are available to all pupils, although in some schools
these are studied as an extracurricular subject. In addition to teaching, Yn Unnid Gaelgagh/Manx Language
Unit prepares resources including language courses, story books, computer-based teaching materials and
games for use in all schools.

62. During the on-the-spot-visit, the Committee of Experts was informed that the authorities envisage
Opening a second secondary school in order to meet increasing demands expressed by the parents and

pupils.

12
63. The authorities also report that a weekly youth group for children over 11 years of age is being run by
the Department of Education and Children in conjunction with the Manx Heritage Foundation. This youth
group has now been running for three years. The Manx Youth Group Possan Aeglagh is based at Peel and
also will be meeting in Douglas to meet the needs of its members. In 2011 the Holiday Venture Scheme
Possan Souree was also run.

Scots

64. Scottish Studies is being developed as a strand in the curriculum in order to improve the knowledge of
Scottish history and culture. During the on-the-spot-visit, the Committee of Experts was made aware that for
the moment there is no recent Scots Grammar book and that a revised Scots Grammar book and a concise
Scots Dictionary will be prepared.

g. the provision of facilities enabling non-speakers of a regional or minority language living in the area where it is
used to learn it if they so desire;

Cornish

65. According to the information reported by the authorities, adult class provision has remained steady,
and two classes are currently maintained under the Adult Education system. The Cornish Language
Partnership support to private classes has moved focus from paying for accessible venues to supporting the
teachers. The CLP is also beginning to regulate these classes to ensure a common level of administration,
advice on teaching practices and in the longer term to ensure quality control. According to the authorities,
geographical distribution is adequate. The authorities also reported that the CLP has two part-time education
staff. The focus now needs to be on building teaching skills and training new teachers to join the volunteer
workforce. During the on-the-spot visit the Committee of Experts was made aware that adult education
remains a difficult sector, funding and support available has been qualified as a piece-meal approach,
heavily depending on volunteer efforts.

66. The authorities also report that intensive weekend courses have been created for beginner,
intermediate and accomplished speakers aimed at increasing fluency, on top of the existing online courses,
the production of a series of short films, half an hour of Cornish-speaking programmes per week by Radio an
Gernewegva, several new learning resources published by the voluntary language associations and the
examinations that are organised. The Cornish Language Board continues to prepare and administer
examinations at four grades, while the Asset language accredited exams are being taken by a growing
number of students.

Manx Gaelic
67. In the fourth periodical report, the Committee of Experts was informed of the establishment of an
integrated Adult Language education programme.

Scots

68. In the third evaluation report, the Committee of Experts asked for more concrete information about
the practical possibilities to learn Scots, especially regarding out-of-school learning opportunities. The fourth
periodical report states that some measures are taken to offer teachers the teaching of Scots as a Continuing
Professional Development Programme.

Scottish Gaelic

69. In the fourth periodical report, the authorities add that a Gaelic learners  website
was launched in October 2011. This site combines both new material and already
existing material and contains Gaelic learning support materials for all levels. The Scottish Government was
the principal funder of this resource.

Ulster Scots

70. In the third evaluation report, the Committee of Experts noted that according to the representatives of
the Ulster Scots-speakers, none of the colleges that provide further and adult education offer Ulster Scots
language classes. No new information was brought to the attention of the Committee of Experts in the fourth
periodical report.

71. During the on-the-spot-visit, the Committee of Experts was informed that summer schools and festivals
were organised with the help of the Ulster-Scots Academy in order to promote Ulster Scots as a language.

13
Welsh

72. According to the information reported by the authorities, all Welsh-medium statutory nursery and
primary provision is open to children who come from non-Welsh-speaking homes. In addition, the Welsh
Government continues to provide funding to local authorities for latecomers  centres that provide intensive
Welsh courses for children who have had no previous contact with the Welsh language. Moreover, Welsh for
Adults continues to be one of the largest adult learning programmes in Wales. Since the last monitoring
round, two specific courses for families have been developed.

73. During the on-the-spot visit concern was raised by Welsh language NGOs about what the latest
census figures reveal about the areas where the language has traditionally been strong. According to the
NGOs the figures suggest that the number of people not speaking Welsh moving into these areas is causing
a shift in the linguistic balance, which might cause serious detriment to the sustainability of Welsh as a
community language. In the past, such newcomers have successfully integrated into the local communities
through acquiring Welsh, often with the assistance of special teaching programmes made available by the
authorities. In respect of the latest figures, however, the concern is that the resources dedicated to these
methods may not be adequate, because of the scale of the population movement involved. The Committee
of Experts invites the authorities to comment on this issue in the next periodical report.

h. the promotion of study and research on regional or minority languages at universities or equivalent
institutions;

Cornish

TA. In the fourth periodical report, the authorities reported that the undergraduate Cornish Studies
provision at the University of Exeter was no longer offered, though the postgraduate research programme
continued through the Institute of Cornish Studies. The Cornish Language Partnership did not commission
further research and concentrates its resources on teaching and learning. Research into the language itself
is being carried out through the Partnership s volunteer working groups for corpus studies and signage.
Further research and publications on an academic level remain an aim for the future. During the on-the-spot
visit, the Committee of Experts received no specific comments concerning research facilities at university
level, but the Cornish representatives expressed their concern about the lack of engagement by central
authorities in London as regards providing additional resources needed.

Welsh

75. In March 2011 the National Welsh-language College (Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol) was established
with the aim to develop and broaden the range of Welsh-medium study opportunities at universities in Wales.
The Committee of Experts looks forward to receiving additional information on the studies that are being
carried out concerning the Welsh language. (See Part

i. the promotion of appropriate types of transnational exchanges, in the fields covered by this Charter, for
regional or minority languages used in identical or similar form in two or more States.

Cornish

76. According to the fourth evaluation report, over the past three years the Cornish Language
Partnership has taken part in various types of transnational exchanges, inter alia in the North American
Association of Celtic Language Teachers. The authorities also reported the possibility of having a linguistic
exchange programme with Brittany. The Committee of Experts looks forward to receiving further information
on these linguistic exchanges in the next periodical report.

Welsh

77. According to the fourth evaluation report, the Welsh Government continues to fund the Welsh
Language Teaching Project in the Chubut province of Argentina; the a division of the Welsh
Government, has promoted co-operation between museums, archives and libraries in Wales and Welsh
museums, archives and libraries in Patagonia.

Paragraph 2

The Parties undertake to eliminate, if they have not yet done so, any unjustified distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference
relating to the use of a regional or minority language and intended to discourage or endanger the maintenance or
development of it. The adoption of special measures in favour of regional or minority languages aimed at promoting equality
between the users of these languages and the rest of the population or which take due account of their specific conditions is
not considered to be an act of discrimination against the users of more widely-used languages.

14
Irish

78. The Committee of Experts still considers the active prohibition of the use of Irish in court as a
restriction relating to the use of the language. The UK authorities have not provided any justification for this
restriction. Moreover, the Committee of Experts notes that applicants for citizenship in the UK as well as for
residency can take their citizenship and residency test in English, Welsh or Scottish Gaelic, but not in Irish.
No justifications for this were provided by the authorities in the fourth periodical report. During the on-the-
spot visit the Committee of Experts received information that nothing has been done to comply with these
provisions under the Charter with respect to Irish.

Paragraph 3

The Parties undertake to promote, by appropriate measures, mutual understanding between all the linguistic groups of the
country and in particular the inclusion of respect, understanding and tolerance in relation to regional or minority languages
among the objectives of education and training provided within their countries and encouragement of the mass media to
pursue the same objective.

79. The Committee of Experts was concerned to learn that speakers of regional minority languages
continued to be portrayed in a negative way in the media. No information was provided by the authorities
about steps taken to combat this problem.

80. According to the fourth periodical report, and as regards Cornish, some actions continue to be taken
to promote mutual respect. No information has been reported as to the other languages.

Paragraph 4

In determining their policy with regard to regional or minority languages, the Parties shall take into consideration the needs
and wishes expressed by the groups which use such languages. They are encouraged to establish bodies, if necessary, for
the purpose of advising the authorities on all matters pertaining to regional or minority languages.

81. In general it appears that the authorities at the level of devolved government in the UK have

developed a pattern of close consultations with representatives of speakers of minority languages. However,
evidence suggests that there is virtually no such consultation at the level of central government.

15
3.2. Evaluation in respect of Part Ill of the Charter

82. In this section, the Committee of Experts will focus on problematic areas and new developments in
the protection and promotion of Welsh, Scottish Gaelic and Irish. It will therefore not assess the
implementation of provisions which were fulfilled in the previous monitoring cycle(s), apart from such
undertakings where the Committee of Experts has received new relevant information. The following
provisions will not be commented upon:

In the case of Welsh:
- Article 8, paragraph f.ii; g; h;
- Article 9, paragraph 1.a.1i; a.ili; b.ii; b.1i1; C.1i; C.ili; d; paragraph 2.b.
- Article 10, paragraph 1.6; c; paragraph 2.g; paragraph 4.a; paragraph 5;
- Article 11, paragraph 1.d; e. f.ii; i; paragraph 2; paragraph 3;
- Article 12, paragraph 1.paragraph 2;
- Article 13, paragraph 1.a; c; paragraph 2.b; e.

In the case of Scottish Gaelic:
- Article 8, paragraph 1. paragraph 2;
- Article 9, paragarph 1.b..ii;
- Article 10, paragraph 2.e; paragraph 5;
- Article 11, paragraph 1.b.ii;c.ii; d;e.ii; f. ii; g; paragraph 2;
- Article 12, paragraph 1.a;d; f; g; h; paragraph 2; paragraph 3;
- Article 13, paragraph 1.a; c;
- Article 14, a; b.

In the case of Irish:
- Article 8, paragraph 1.d.iv; f.li; g; paragraph 2;
- Article 10, paragraph 5;
- Article 11, paragraph 1. d; g, paragraph 2;
- Article 12, paragraph 1.a; d; f; h; paragraph 2;
- Article 13, paragraph 1.d;
- Article 14, a; b.

83. For these provisions, the Committee of Experts refers to the conclusions reached in its previous
report but reserves the right to evaluate the situation again at a later stage.

84. Finally the paragraphs and sub-paragraphs that are quoted in bold italics are the obligations chosen
by the United Kingdom.

3.2.1. The Welsh language
Article 8 Education

Paragraph 1

With regard to education, the Parties undertake, within the territory in which such languages are used, according to the situation
of each of these languages, and without prejudice to the teaching of the official language(s) of the State:

Pre-school Education
ne to make available pre-school education in the relevant regional or minority languages;

85. In the third evaluation report the Committee of Experts considered the undertaking fulfilled.

86. In the fourth periodical report the authorities stated that from the term following their third birthday, all
3 and 4-year-olds are entitled to a free part-time (minimum of 10 hours a week), Early Years Foundation
Phase place. Through the Foundation Phase and its statutory curriculum, children will have the opportunity
to acquire and progressively improve their Welsh-language skills through the Language Literacy and
Communication Skills Area of Learning (in Welsh-medium settings) or the Welsh Language Development
Area of Learning (in English-Medium settings where Welsh is taught as a second language). The Foundation
Phase is delivered through a mixed economy of providers in the maintained sector schools) and the
non-maintained voluntary sector, which predominantly consists of Mudiad Meithrin (an organisation which

16
receives grant funding) in the Welsh Medium sector. Mudiad Meithrin is a Welsh language nursery education
provider which runs around 1000 community based pre-school and mother and toddler groups.

87. During the on-the-spot visit some NGOs expressed concerns that local authorities are not sufficiently
involved and actively supporting Welsh Medium Education. The concerns voiced indicate that local
authorities are not planning ahead enough in order to meet demands expressed by parents in terms of
nursery schools and pre-school education capacities.

88. The Committee of Experts asks the authorities to provide for a more structured approach when
planning for additional nursery and pre-school education in order for needs to be met.

89. The Committee of Experts considers that the undertaking remains fulfilled.

Primary Education

bi. to make available primary education in the relevant regional or minority languages;

90. In the third evaluation report, the Committee of Experts reminded the authorities that this undertaking
requires Welsh medium education wherever the situation on the ground justifies it. There is still evidence of
substantial unmet demand in parts of Wales for Welsh medium primary education.

91. In the fourth periodical report, the Committee of Experts was informed by the authorities that Primary
Welsh Medium and bilingual models of provision are available to parents or guardians who so desire it for
their children in all 22 local authorities. In January 2011, there were 419 Welsh Medium primary schools,
where Welsh is the sole/main medium of instruction, and 48 bilingual schools, where Welsh-medium
provision is used for part of the curriculum. Welsh as a second language was taught in all 968 English-
Medium schools, and assessed at the end of Key Stage 2 (11 years old).

92. Since the last report, 14 authorities have undertaken parental surveys of demand for Welsh Medium
education. As a result, 10 new schools or seed classes have opened since 2009 and 5 schools or seed
classes were planned to open from 2012 onwards. The Committee of Experts considers this to be a very
positive development. The gap between demand for and provision of Welsh-medium primary education
nevertheless remains large in many counties. The Committee acknowledges that bridging the gap is not
something that can be achieved overnight but is confident that the authorities in Wales are taking their
responsibilities seriously in order to increase the offer.

93. One of the key elements of Welsh Medium Education Strategy was the introduction of a new
planning framework for Welsh Medium education led by the Welsh Government and delivered by local
authorities. This new system replaced the Welsh Education Schemes under the Welsh Language Act 1993.
From December 2011, each local authority was expected to present an annual Welsh in Education Strategic
Plan (WESP) to the Department for Education and Skills including an assessment of the demand for Welsh-
medium education in those areas where choice exists between Welsh Medium and English-Medium
education and the nature of their plans to address that demand.

94. The WESPs have now been placed on a statutory footing as part of the School Standards and
Organisation (Wales) Act 2013. The relevant provisions have not yet, however, come into force. This
requires an order of the Welsh Ministers.

95. The Welsh Government continues to invest annually in the production of Welsh and bilingual
teaching and classroom learning resources to support the teaching and learning of Welsh as a subject, first
and second language, and other subjects through the medium of Welsh. The resources are learner
classroom materials that the commercial market fails to provide and are available in a variety of media (print,
online, CD-ROMs, DVDs). Materials are commissioned across the whole range of curriculum areas taught in
schools, and for pupils of all abilities, including the provision of materials for those with special educational
needs. Original resources are commissioned as well as the translation/adaptation of existing published
materials into Welsh.

96. To assist with the work of producing Welsh language resources, the Welsh Government has also

supported the production of an on-line educational terminology service. It was launched in 2012, and may be
accessed at

17
97. During the on-the-spot visit the Committee of Experts was informed that there will be substantial cuts
in spending by local authorities and that therefore the opening of new schools will become increasingly
difficult.

98. The Committee of Experts welcomes the approach chosen by the Welsh Government to require local
education authorities to comply with increasing demands for Welsh Medium education, and the statutory
basis for making and implementing Welsh education strategic plans. The Committee of Experts asks the
authorities to provide for targeted information on this undertaking in the next periodical report.

99. The Committee of Experts is impressed by the work done by Welsh Government in promoting Welsh
Medium primary education. However, based on the information that there is still a substantial unmet demand
for Welsh Medium primary education, the Committee of Experts considers that the undertaking is partly
fulfilled.

Secondary Education

6. to make available secondary education in the relevant regional or minority languages;

100. In the third evaluation report the Committee of Experts commended the authorities for measures
taken to improve the offer of Welsh Medium secondary education and encouraged them to pursue their
efforts further to overcome the problems identified. It considered the undertaking partly fulfilled.

101. According to the fourth periodical report the problem of continuity between primary and secondary
education still seems to persist. The Committee of Experts notes that these problems should be addressed
by the authorities and steps should be taken to overcome these difficulties.

102. Welsh-medium or bilingual secondary education is available throughout Wales to varying degrees.
There are 32 Welsh-medium schools in the secondary sector and 24 bilingual schools, where Welsh Medium
provision is used for part of the curriculum. One additional Welsh Medium secondary school was opened in
2012 as the third such school in Cardiff. Welsh as a second language is taught in all 165 English Medium
schools.

103. Welsh in Education Strategic Plans will also require local authorities to outline their plans for Welsh
Medium and bilingual secondary education for approval and monitoring by the Welsh Government.

104. During the on the-spot-visit representatives from NGOs were critical of the fact that strategic plans
were very slow in being released. They were also concerned that new consortium arrangements might put
Welsh Medium secondary schools at a disadvantage. They felt that Welsh Medium education was seen
within the civil service and also at local authority level as being a  bolt on  rather than as an integral part of
education. The provision of Welsh-medium secondary education nevertheless remains patchy in many parts
of Wales and absent in some counties.

105. The Committee of Experts notes the progress made in relation to Welsh Medium secondary
education. However in the light of the information received, the Committee of Experts considers that the
undertaking remains partly fulfilled and urges the authorities to strengthen their efforts to meet the demands
for Welsh Medium secondary education and to ensure continuity between primary and secondary education
offer.

Technical and vocational education

da i. to make available technical and vocational education in the relevant regional or minority languages; or

ii. to make available a substantial part of technical and vocational education in the relevant regional or minority
languages; or

ili. to provide, within technical and vocational education, for the teaching of the relevant regional or minority languages
as an integral part of the curriculum; or

iv. to apply one of the measures provided for under i to above at least to those pupils who, or where
appropriate whose families, so wish in a number considered sufficient

106.  _In the third evaluation report the Committee of Experts admitted that progress in this field is slowly
increasing. It c"
